        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The problem demands the array to be modified in-place. If <code>in-place</code> was not a constraint we might
            have just copied the elements from a source array to a destination array.</p>

        <br>
        Notice, how we copied zero twice.
        <pre><code>  s = 0
      d = 0
    
      <span class="hljs-comment"># Copy is performed until the destination array is full.</span>
      <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> s <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> range(N):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>[s] == 0:
          <span class="hljs-comment"># Copy zero twice.</span>
          destination[d] = 0
          d += 1
          destination[d] = 0
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
          destination[d] = <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>[s]
    
        d += 1
    </code></pre>
        <p>The problem statement also mentions that we do not grow the new array, rather we just trim it to its original
            array length. This means we have to discard some elements from the end of the array. These are the elements
            whose new indices are beyond the length of the original array.</p>

        </center>
        <p>Let's remind ourselves about the problem constraint that we are given. Since we can't use extra space, our
            source and destination array is essentially the same. We just can't go about copying the source into
            destination array the same way. If we do that we would lose some elements. Since, we would be overwriting
            the array.</p>

            <img src="1089_Duplicate_Zeros_3.png" width="600">
        </center>
        <p>Keeping this in mind, in the approach below we start copying to the end of the array.</p>
        <h4 id="approach-1-two-pass,-o1-space">Approach 1: Two pass, O(1) space</h4>
        <p><strong>Intuition</strong></p>
        <p>If we know the number of elements which would be discarded from the end of the array, we can copy the rest.
            How do we find out how many elements would be discarded in the end? The number would be equal to the number
            of extra zeros which would be added to the array. The extra zero would create space for itself by pushing
            out an element from the end of the array.</p>
        <p>Once we know how many elements from the original array would be part of the final array, we can just start
            copying from the end. Copying from the end ensures we don't lose any element since, the last few extraneous
            elements can be overwritten.</p>
        <p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Find the number of zeros which would be duplicated. Let's call it <code>possible_dups</code>. We do
                    need to make sure we are not counting the zeros which would be trimmed off. Since, the discarded
                    zeros won't be part of the final array. The count of <code>possible_dups</code> would give us the
                    number of elements to be trimmed off the original array. Hence at any point,
                    <code>length_ - possible_dups</code> is the number of elements which would be included in the final
                    array.
                </p>

                Note: In the diagram above we just show source and destination array for understanding purpose. We will
                be doing these operations only on one array.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Handle the edge case for a zero present on the boundary of the leftover elements.</p>
                <p>Let's talk about the edge case of this problem. We need to be extra careful when we are duplicating
                    the zeros in the leftover array. This care should be taken for the <code>zero</code> which is lying
                    on the boundary. Since, this zero might be counted as with possible duplicates, or may be just got
                    included in the left over when there was no space left to accommodate its duplicate. If it is part
                    of the <code>possible_dups</code> we would want to duplicate it otherwise we don't.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>An example of the edge case is - [8,4,5,0,0,0,0,7].
                        In this array there is space to accommodate the duplicates of first and second occurrences of
                        zero. But we don't have enough space for the duplicate of the third occurrence of zero.
                        Hence when we are copying we need to make sure for the third occurrence we don't copy twice.
                        Result = [8,4,5,0,<code>0</code>,0,<code>0</code>,0]</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Iterate the array from the end and copy a non-zero element once and zero element twice.
                    When we say we discard the extraneous elements, it simply means we start from the left of the
                    extraneous elements and start overwriting them with new values, eventually right shifting the left
                    over elements and creating space for all the duplicated elements in the array.</p>
