// 101. Symmetric Tree
// https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

/*
    Time: O(N) Because we traverse the entire input tree once, the total run time is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.
    Space: O(H) The number of recursive calls is bound by the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is linear and the height is in O(n). Therefore, space complexity due to recursive calls on the stack is O(n) in the worst case.
