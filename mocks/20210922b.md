You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.

Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

Output: [7,0,8]

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Brute Force approach:
Iterate through both linked lists and store corresponding numbers in two arrays
l1_list = [2,4,3], l2_list = [5,6,4]
Perform the usual addition of two non-negative numbers keeping in mind the carry
Create dummy node and as we iterate through the result array we build up our linked list as an answer
return dummyNode.next

Second approach (Optimized?):
Create dummy node and two extra pointers (p1 and p2) to account for input linked lists
p1 ? 2 ? 4 ? 3
p2 ? 5 ? 6 ? 4
dummyNode ?
result ? dummyNode 
carry = 0
i = 0 : cur_sum = 2 + 5 + carry = 7, carry = cur_sum // 10, cur_DIGIT
 = cur_sum % 10
dummyNode.next = Node(cur_DIGIT)
dummyNode = dummyNode.next

p1 ? 2 ? 4 ? 3
p2 ? 5 ? 6

        dummyNode = Node()
        result = dummyNode
        carry = 0
        while p1 or p2 or carry > 0:
            cur_sum = p1.val + p2.val + carry
            carry = cur_sum // 10
            cur_DIGIT = cur_sum % 10
            dummyNode.next = Node(cur_DIGIT)
            if p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
            
        return result.next
