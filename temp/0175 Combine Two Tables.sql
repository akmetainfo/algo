/* Task

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.

 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State


*/

/* Prepare data

Create table Person (PersonId int, FirstName varchar(255), LastName varchar(255))
Create table Address (AddressId int, PersonId int, City varchar(255), State varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (PersonId, LastName, FirstName) values ('1', 'Wang', 'Allen')
Truncate table Address
insert into Address (AddressId, PersonId, City, State) values ('1', '2', 'New York City', 'New York')

*/

/* My solution

SELECT P.FirstName, P.LastName, a.City, a.State FROM dbo.Person p
LEFT JOIN dbo.[Address] a ON p.PersonId =  a.PersonId
WHERE 1 = 1


*/

/* Solution

Approach: Using outer join [Accepted]

Algorithm

Since the PersonId in table Address is the foreign key of table Person, we can join this two table to get the address information of a person.

Considering there might not be an address information for every person, we should use outer join instead of the default inner join.

MySQL

select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
;

    Note: Using where clause to filter the records will fail if there is no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
